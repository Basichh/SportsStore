<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>
    Many people know the issue of going to a vending machine expecting a drink that they want and to their surprise, the machine doesn't have the drink they desire.
    Therefore our goal is to provide Students and Staff a variety of drinks that they will need without the hassle of finding a vending machine or driving to a store that may not have the drink they need.
    At UNFDrinks, you request what drinks you need and how many drinks you need and then we deliver it straight to you in our packages.
    What makes us different is the fact that we deliver our products to dormitories, something that most services aren't able to do.
    All you have to do is order from your phone or computer and it's that easy!
</p>

<h3> How our Business works</h3>
<p>
    If you need refreshments such as water, caffeinated drinks, or sports drinks, go to our website and browse our catalog.
    Once you found what you are looking for, add them to your cart and checkout. All that is needed is your name, billing address, the city you are in,
    State, Zip Code, Country, and whether or not you want your items gift wrapped or not. Once that is filled out, click the complete order button and wait for your
    items to be delivered!
